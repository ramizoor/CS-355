# Blog App

## Description
A simple blog application using Express and Handlebars.

## Setup

The 5 files needed are labeled as "Assignment 4" in their last commit message.

They are:
1. express-handlebars.js
2. home.hbs
3. main.hbs
4. post.hbs
5. style.css

Next, get to the the express-handlebars file location and type "node express-handlebars.js" into the terminal. Then open http://localhost:3000. You can use /post/:id to get to individual posts and you can add new posts with a setup at the bottom. I used ChatGPT to help style the blog.
